Howdy! My name is Corey and I am a senior undergraduate Mathematics student at Virginia Tech. 
Unfortunately for me, my education track does not involve a ton of courses with programming (I find it really interesting). 
Those that do have mostly been cryptography courses, a field of math dedicated to the encryption and decryption of messages. 

Outside of school, I love playing card games: blackjack, spades, texas hold 'em, everything. 
To practice my coding skills and, more importantly, get an edge over my friends a family, I wish to code some of my favorite card games to be able to play whenever I want. 

So, this is a place for me to share some of the few assignments I am able to share or the projects I have made for fun! 
If you are looking to collaborate or wish to roast me for my lack of programming skills, I can be contacted at coreyd39@vt.edu.
